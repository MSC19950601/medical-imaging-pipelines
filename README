This code implements the registration pipeline described in the paper:

Quantification and Analaysis of Large Multimodal Clinical Image Studies:
Application to Stroke by Sridharan et al.

pipebuild.py provides a set of building blocks for building simple, quick
registration pipelines, while regpipe.py shows an example registration pipeline
(see the paper above for a technical description of the design choices in the
pipeline).

Using this code requires the following software packages:

ANTs (image registration, etc): http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/

For python:
  numpy, scipy: http://www.scipy.org/
  nibabel: http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nibabel/
