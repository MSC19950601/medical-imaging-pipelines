This code implements the registration pipeline described in the paper:

Quantification and Analaysis of Large Multimodal Clinical Image Studies:
Application to Stroke by Sridharan et al.

pipebuild.py provides a set of building blocks for building simple, quick
registration pipelines, while regpipe.py shows an example registration pipeline
(see the paper above for a technical description of the design choices in the
pipeline).
